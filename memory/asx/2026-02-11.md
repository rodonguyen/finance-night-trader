# ASX Session — 2026-02-11 (Wednesday)

## Market Conditions
- ASX 200: +0.81% (8,940). Financials leading (+2.84%), Healthcare crashing (-3.93%)
- Major movers: CSL -8% (CEO exit + weak earnings), CBA +6.5% (earnings beat), AGL +7.6% (earnings beat)
- Uranium weak: BOE -3.5%, PDN -2.4%, BMN -2.9%
- RBA hiked to 3.85% on Feb 3 (macro headwind for capex-heavy names)

## Research Completed
- Full R1/R2/Supervisor process run for first time on ASX
- R1 found: AGL PROCEED, CSL WAIT, CBA PASS, BOE/PDN WAIT
- R2 added: RBA rate hike context (R1 missed!), STO pre-results watchlist, COH tomorrow, lithium revival
- Joint submission: AGL at A$8.50, CSL staged A$155-158 Fri, STO watchlist A$6.65
- Supervisor: APPROVED AGL + CSL Stage 1 (conditional), STO watchlist

## Trades Executed
- **NONE** — AGL gapped up to A$9.52 on earnings beat, well above A$8.50 entry zone
- Discipline held: no chasing

## Watchlist
| Symbol | Entry Zone | Trigger | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| AGL | A$8.50 or below | Pullback from earnings gap | Through Fri Feb 13 |
| CSL | A$155-158 | 2 sessions above A$155 | Fri Feb 13 earliest |
| STO | A$6.65 or below | Pullback + R1 review | Pre Feb 18 results |
| COH | A$230-240 | Tomorrow's results (Feb 12) | Tomorrow |
| BOE | A$1.50-1.55 | Uranium stabilization | 1-2 weeks |
| PDN | A$10.50-11.00 | Post Feb 25 results | Late Feb |

## Lessons
1. **Read prior research before spawning agents** — R1 wasn't explicitly given yesterday's research files. It found AGL anyway but could have missed context. Fixed the night-trader agent to make Step 0 (read prior research) mandatory.
2. **R2 caught R1's macro blind spot** — R1 missed the RBA rate hike entirely. The dual-analyst adversarial process works.
3. **Entry discipline saved us** — AGL beat earnings but our A$8.50 entry was never reachable today. No FOMO. Capital preserved.
4. **Yahoo Finance works for ASX** — Finnhub free tier doesn't support ASX. Fixed scripts to use Yahoo.

## P&L
- Cash: A$10,000 | Positions: 0 | Equity: A$10,000 | P&L: A$0

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Check COH results (Feb 12) for healthcare sympathy trade
- Monitor AGL for pullback toward A$8.50
- Monitor CSL price discovery Day 2
- Check STO for pullback toward A$6.65
