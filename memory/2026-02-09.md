# 2026-02-09 — Pre-Market Scan (Sunday)

## Research Team Workflow (First Run)

R1 + R2 independent research → debate → joint submission → supervisor APPROVED.

## UEC Position Update

- Entry: $15.58, current ~$16-$18 range
- **Stop moved: $14.50 → $15.58 (breakeven)**
- Management plan: sell 50% at $18, trail rest
- Goldman raised target to $18. Thesis strengthening.
- Unrealized P&L: ~+3.5% to +14.6% (depending on exact close)

## Key Decisions

1. **Wait for CPI (Feb 11) before any new entries.** Both R1 and R2 agreed macro risk too high (NFP Wed + CPI Fri).
2. **Exception:** AMD at $200 with tight $194 stop — conditionally approved by supervisor at half-size ($1,000).

## Watchlist (Post-CPI)

| Symbol | Entry | Stop | Target | R:R | Source |
|--------|-------|------|--------|-----|--------|
| AMD | $200-$205 | $194 | $225 | 2.75:1 | R1 |
| PYPL | $51-$53 | $48.50 | $62 | 2.5:1 | R2 |
| FCX | $59-$60 | $56 | $68 | 2.0:1 | R2 |
| NVDA | $180-$183 | $175 | $197 | 2.8:1 | R1 |

## Emerging Theme

"The Great Rebalancing" — materials +9% YTD, tech -0.4%. Money flowing from AI software to physical infrastructure and safe havens. UEC fits this theme.

## Account

- Cash: $8,000
- UEC: $2,000 (128.35 shares)
- Positions: 1/5
- No trades today (Sunday, market closed)

## Lessons

1. Research team workflow produced better output than single-advisor scan — R2 found PYPL/FCX/materials rotation that R1 missed entirely
2. Timing discipline matters: don't enter before known macro events
3. Stop management discipline: move to breakeven at 1:1 R:R, don't wait
