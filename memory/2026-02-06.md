### Wider Scan Opportunities

- Stop: $14.50 (risk: $138.62)
- Target: $18.00 (reward: $310.53)
- R:R: 2.2:1
- Thesis: Uranium at $100/lb 20-month high, structural supply deficit, pullback entry

### Passed On

- **ADNT** — Already ran to $25.94, R:R collapsed to 1:1
- **ROIV** — Up 17.4% today, chasing reckless

### Lessons

1. Scanner defaults are a starting point — wider scan found better setups (ADNT, UEC)
2. Most "hot" movers fail R:R test at current prices — discipline matters
3. UEC fit the institutional framework: uranium is a bottleneck play in nuclear/AI power theme
