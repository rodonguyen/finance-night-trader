## Key Movers Researched

| Symbol | Price | Move | Catalyst | Action |
|--------|-------|------|----------|--------|
| CSL | A$158.00 | -7.81% | CEO exit + weak 1H earnings | WAIT |
| CBA | A$169.07 | +6.51% | 1H profit beat + dividend up | PASS |
| AGL | TBD | Reporting today | 1H beat consensus, guidance narrowed | PROCEED (swing) |
| BOE | A$1.68 | -3.46% | U3O8 spot volatility | WAIT |
| PDN | A$11.85 | -2.35% | U3O8 spot volatility | WAIT |
| BMN | A$3.97 | -2.93% | U3O8 spot volatility | PASS |

## Positions: ZERO (fresh account A$10,000)

## Recommendations Summary
1. **AGL Energy** -- PROCEED as swing trade. Results beat consensus, valuation compelling at ~10x P/E with 5%+ yield. Entry A$8.50-8.85 zone.
2. **CSL** -- WAIT for dust to settle. CEO departure + $1.1B impairments create uncertainty. Potential swing/position trade in coming days if it stabilizes near A$155-160.
3. **Uranium sector** -- WAIT. Structural bull thesis intact but current pullback may not be over. BOE and PDN approaching prior research entry zones.
4. **CBA** -- PASS. Massive earnings beat rally but 25x P/E, "strong sell" consensus, and A$124 average analyst target makes this untouchable.
