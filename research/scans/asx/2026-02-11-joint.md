# JOINT SUBMISSION: R1 + R2 -- 2026-02-11 (ASX)
**Time:** 11:00 AM AEST | **Market:** OPEN | **Account:** A$10,000, ZERO positions
**Submitted to:** Supervisor (Night Trader)

---

## Executive Summary

Two independent research advisors have analyzed today's ASX market. There is broad agreement on what to AVOID (CBA, uranium at current levels) and partial agreement on what to BUY (AGL). R2 has added several opportunities R1 did not examine, most notably CSL as a higher-priority contrarian play and STO as a pre-results watchlist name.

**Key macro context R1 missed:** The RBA hiked rates to 3.85% on Feb 3 (first since Nov 2023) with 2 more hikes priced in. This changes the calculus for capital-intensive names like AGL and favors cash-flow-generating producers.

---

## CONSENSUS ACTIONS (Both Advisors Agree)

### PASS: CBA
- **Unanimous.** 25x P/E, A$169 vs A$124 analyst average target. "Strong sell" from 14/14 analysts. No trade.

### WAIT: BOE (Boss Energy)
- **Unanimous.** Need A$1.50-1.55 entry. Currently A$1.68. Thesis intact, timing not right.

### WAIT: PDN (Paladin Energy)
- **Unanimous.** Need A$10.50-11.00 entry. Currently A$11.85 (above analyst consensus target). Wait for Feb 25 results and pullback.

## ACTIONABLE TRADES (Ordered by Priority)

### Trade 1: AGL Energy -- SWING TRADE
**R1: PROCEED (HIGH conviction) | R2: CONDITIONAL PROCEED (MEDIUM conviction)**

Both advisors agree this is actionable. R2 urges tighter discipline.

| Parameter | R1 | R2 | JOINT |
|-----------|----|----|-------|
| Entry | A$8.50-8.90 | A$8.50 MAX | **A$8.50 or below** |
| Stop | A$8.00 | A$8.00 | **A$8.00** |
| Target | A$9.80 | A$9.80 | **A$9.80** |
| R:R (at A$8.50) | 2.60:1 | 2.60:1 | **2.60:1 (passes)** |
| Position size | A$2,000 | A$1,500 | **A$1,500** |
| Conviction | HIGH | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

**Joint conditions:**
1. Entry MUST be at A$8.50 or below. Do NOT chase above A$8.60.
2. Reduced position size to A$1,500 (R2 concern: declining earnings + RBA headwind)
3. At A$8.50: ~176 shares. Risk = 176 x A$0.50 = A$88 (well within A$200 limit)
4. If price opens above A$8.80 and holds, WAIT for pullback this week
5. Hard stop at A$8.00 -- no moving it down

**Bull case:** 15% earnings beat, CEO insider buying at A$8.84, 5.4% yield floor, 10x P/E, data center power exposure, telco divestiture simplification.

**Bear case (R2 additions):** Earnings declining -6.4% YoY, 2H seasonally weaker, heavy capex phase, RBA rate hikes increase borrowing costs, wholesale electricity margin risk could threaten dividend.

**Thesis kill:** If AGL closes below A$8.20 any day this week, the thesis is damaged. Re-evaluate before stop hit.

---

### Trade 2: CSL -- SWING/POSITION TRADE (R2 Addition)
**R1: WAIT (A$150-155) | R2: CONDITIONAL PROCEED (A$155-160)**

R2 argues CSL is the better risk-adjusted trade. R1 agrees on the thesis but wants a lower entry. Joint recommendation is a STAGED approach.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Entry** | Stage 1: A$155-158 (this week, if stabilizes) |
| | Stage 2: A$148-152 (if further weakness, next week) |
| **Stop** | A$145 (below A$150 psychological) |
| **Target** | A$185 (conservative -- analyst avg is A$232) |
| **R:R at A$158** | (A$185 - A$158) / (A$158 - A$145) = A$27 / A$13 = **2.08:1** |
| **R:R at A$150** | (A$185 - A$150) / (A$150 - A$145) = A$35 / A$5 = **7.0:1** |
| **Position size** | A$1,500 at Stage 1. Add A$500 at Stage 2 if reached. |
| **Conviction** | MEDIUM (Stage 1), HIGH (if Stage 2 reached) |

**Conditions:**
1. Need 2 sessions of price holding A$155-165 before Stage 1 entry (no day-one buying)
2. Watch for analyst target revisions this week -- if average drops below A$200, reduce conviction
3. Monitor permanent CEO search news -- any credible appointment is a positive catalyst
4. Max total position: A$2,000 across both stages

**Edge:** 32% below analyst average target. 9 Buy / 4 Hold / 0 Sell ratings. Quality franchise with one-off impairments. Maintained guidance.

**Risk:** No permanent CEO, revenue declining -4%, potential further analyst downgrades, catching a falling knife.

**Timeline:** Assess Fri Feb 13. If holding A$155+, Stage 1 entry. Stage 2 only if reaches A$148-152.

### Trade 3: STO (Santos) -- WATCHLIST / PRE-RESULTS
**R1: Not analyzed today | R2: WATCHLIST**

STO was yesterday's #2 pick at A$6.50-6.80. Currently ~A$6.89-6.94. FY25 results Feb 18-20.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Entry** | A$6.60-6.70 (need pullback from A$6.94) |
| **Stop** | A$6.30 |
| **Target** | A$7.50-7.80 |
| **R:R at A$6.70** | (A$7.50 - A$6.70) / (A$6.70 - A$6.30) = 2.0:1 (borderline at A$7.50 target) |
| **Conviction** | MEDIUM |

**Conditions:**
1. Only enter if pulls back to A$6.60-6.70 before Feb 18 results
2. Brent crude at US$68.80 is a headwind -- if oil breaks below US$66, shelve this
3. Barossa de-risking (first cargo shipped) is the key positive
4. Results on Feb 18 are the binary catalyst

**Not actionable today. Monitor daily.**

## WATCH LIST (Not Actionable Today)

| Symbol | Trigger | Why | Timeline |
|--------|---------|-----|----------|
| **COH** | Feb 12 results | Healthcare sympathy selling may create entry at A$230-240 if miss | Tomorrow |
| **PLS** | A$3.80-4.00 | Lithium/spodumene revival theme. Already rallied 312% from lows. | This month |
| **WTC** | Feb 25 results | A$49 vs A$101 analyst target. Massive gap. Needs thesis review. | Feb 25 |
| **BOE** | A$1.50-1.55 | Uranium thesis intact, need lower entry | 1-2 weeks |
| **PDN** | Post Feb 25 results, A$10.50-11.00 | Uranium thesis intact, need lower entry + earnings clarity | Post Feb 25 |

---

## Portfolio Strategy Recommendation

Given zero positions and A$10,000 capital, here is the proposed allocation IF all setups trigger:

| Trade | Allocation | Risk | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| AGL (if A$8.50) | A$1,500 | A$88 | This week |
| CSL Stage 1 (if stabilizes A$155-160) | A$1,500 | A$164 | Fri Feb 13+ |
| CSL Stage 2 (if reaches A$148-152) | A$500 | A$40-65 | Next week |
| STO (if A$6.60-6.70) | A$1,500 | A$160 | Pre Feb 18 |
| **Total if all trigger** | **A$5,000** | **A$452** | |

This leaves A$5,000 in reserve (50%) for:
- Uranium entries if they reach target zones (BOE, PDN)
- COH if tomorrow's results create opportunity
- Unexpected setups during reporting season

**Max risk exposure:** A$452 (within A$500 daily loss limit)
**Max positions:** 3-4 (within 5 limit)

---

## Key Dates This Week

| Date | Event | Action Required |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Feb 11 (TODAY)** | AGL results (done), CBA/CSL results | Monitor AGL price for entry signal |
| **Feb 12** | COH results | Watch for healthcare sympathy trade |
| **Feb 13** | CSL price discovery Day 3 | Assess CSL Stage 1 entry |
| **Feb 14** | End of week | Review all positions, decide weekend holds |

---

## Final Notes

1. **R1 and R2 agree:** AGL is the most immediately actionable trade, with strict entry discipline at A$8.50 or below.
2. **R2 adds:** CSL may be the better risk-adjusted opportunity this week, and the RBA rate hike is a macro headwind R1 did not factor in.
3. **Both agree:** Do not chase CBA, uranium needs lower entries, and patience is the edge right now.
4. **New themes to track:** Lithium recovery (PLS), healthcare sympathy selling (COH), bombed-out tech (WTC). These are not actionable today but could produce setups this month.

**Recommendation to Supervisor:** Approve AGL entry at A$8.50 or below with A$1,500 position size. Begin monitoring CSL for Stage 1 entry by Friday.
