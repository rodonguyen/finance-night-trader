# THESIS REVIEW: PDN -- Paladin Energy (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Uranium Pullback Update

**Summary:** PDN down 2.4% to A$11.85. Approaching prior research entry zone of A$10.50-11.50. Analyst average target: A$11.26-11.38 -- consensus sees limited upside from here.

**Trade type:** SWING / POSITION

### Price Context
- Current: A$11.85 (-2.4% today)
- Yesterday (R1 research): A$12.13 (+5.48%)
- 52-week range: A$3.98 - A$14.14
- From highs: -16%
- From lows: +198%
- Analyst avg target: ~A$11.30 (7 buy, 3 sell)
- Interim results: 25 Feb 2026

### What Changed Since Yesterday's Research
- Price dropped from A$12.13 to A$11.85 (closer to our A$10.50-11.50 entry zone)
- U3O8 spot: pulled back from $101.50 to ~$92/lb
- No company-specific news

### Edge
- Largest ASX-listed uranium producer with operating Langer Heinrich mine
- FY26 guidance: 4-4.4M lbs U3O8
- Strong balance sheet: US$278M+ cash
- But analyst consensus target (~A$11.30) is BELOW current price

### Bull Case
- Only major ASX uranium producer with nameplate production approaching
- Structural uranium deficit (Canaccord: -15Mlb 2026, growing to -23Mlb 2028)
- Western security of supply premium
- FY27 full nameplate = significant production uplift

### Bear Case
- At A$11.85, stock is trading ABOVE average analyst target (~A$11.30)
- Already up 198% from April 2025 lows -- much of the re-rating is done
- Interim results Feb 25 could disappoint
- U3O8 spot needs to hold $90+ for current valuation to make sense

### Verdict: WAIT

**Rationale:** PDN is NOT at our entry zone yet. At A$11.85 it trades above the analyst consensus target. The prior research correctly identified A$10.50-11.50 as the accumulation zone. We need:
1. U3O8 spot to stabilize
2. PDN to pull back into A$10.50-11.50 range
3. Ideally, post-earnings (Feb 25) clarity

**If entry zone reached (A$10.50-11.00):**
- Entry: A$10.75
- Stop: A$9.80 (below $10 psychological level)
- Target: A$13.00 (prior resistance)
- R:R: ($13.00 - $10.75) / ($10.75 - $9.80) = $2.25 / $0.95 = 2.37:1
- Position size: A$2,000 / A$10.75 = ~186 shares. Risk = 186 x $0.95 = A$177 (within limit)

**Timeline:** Watch through Feb 25 earnings. Ideal entry is post-results dip into A$10.50-11.00.
