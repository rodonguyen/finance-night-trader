# THESIS REVIEW: CBA (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Post-Earnings Rally

**Summary:** CBA rallied ~6.5% to A$169 after 1H26 profit beat consensus by 5%, with dividend +4% to $2.35.

**Trade type:** N/A -- PASS

### What Happened
- 1H26 Cash NPAT: A$5.45B (+6% YoY), beat consensus of A$5.2B by ~5%
- NIM: 2.04% (slight miss vs 2.05-2.06% consensus)
- Home lending +6.6%, business lending +12.3%
- Impairment expense: A$319M, down 21% -- credit quality strong
- Interim dividend: A$2.35/share (fully franked), +4% YoY, ~74% payout ratio

### Edge
There is NO edge here for us. The rally is the market pricing in a known earnings beat.

### Bull Case
- Dominant franchise, market-leading ROE
- Lending volume growth strong (business +12.3%)
- Credit quality improving (impairments down 21%)
- AI/tech investment may widen competitive moat

### Bear Case (overwhelming)
- **P/E: 25x** vs peer average 15.9x, vs global banks 10x
- **"Strong Sell" consensus** from 14/14 analysts on TipRanks
- **Average analyst target: A$124.60** -- current price A$169 implies ~27% OVERVALUED
- From 2023 low of A$87, stock has rallied ~94% -- priced for perfection
- NIM already under pressure from competition
- Any macro deterioration = significant downside at this valuation

### Verdict: PASS

**Rationale:** This is the most overvalued major stock on the ASX by analyst consensus. A 6.5% rally on an earnings beat does not create a buying opportunity when the stock trades 36% above the average analyst price target. There is no R:R setup here that makes sense.

**Short thesis consideration:** A short/put position could theoretically work but:
- Momentum is violently bullish today
- Shorting overvalued quality stocks is how traders blow up
- We don't short in this account
- Not worth the capital allocation

**No trade. Moving on.**
