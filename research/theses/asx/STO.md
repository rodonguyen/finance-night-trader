# THESIS REVIEW: STO -- Santos (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Pre-Results Watchlist (R2)

**Summary:** STO at A$6.89-6.94, approaching FY25 results on Feb 18-20. Barossa LNG first cargo de-risked. Yesterday's deep dive had entry zone A$6.50-6.80 -- we are slightly above. Weak Brent crude (US$68.80) is a headwind.

**Trade type:** SWING (pre-results accumulation, if pullback)

### Key Developments
- Barossa LNG first cargo shipped 27 Jan 2026 -- major project de-risking
- Pikka (Alaska) approaching first oil in 2026
- FY25 results due Feb 18-20 -- key catalyst
- Revenue LTM: A$8.01B, profit: A$1.57B
- Forward P/E ~7x, dividend yield ~4.3%
- Broker consensus: BUY, average target A$7.24
- CEO Kevin Gallagher: Barossa completed ~6 months late but on budget

### Edge
- FCF inflection: heavy capex phase ending as Barossa comes online
- Dual growth drivers: Barossa (producing) + Pikka (approaching first oil)
- Cheap valuation: 7x P/E for a producer with growing cash flows
- Director buying at lower levels (Sep 2025)

### Bull Case
- Barossa revenues now flowing -- FY25 results should show first LNG contribution
- Pikka Phase 1 first oil in 2026 adds second major growth engine
- A$7.24 average analyst target with upside to A$8+ on execution
- Defensive: contracted LNG volumes, diversified portfolio

### Bear Case
- Brent crude at US$68.80 and falling -- energy prices expected to drop 10% in 2026
- Oil/gas price exposure creates earnings volatility
- Barossa ramp-up: piping system repairs flagged, ramp-up pace uncertain
- ESG/regulatory headwinds on fossil fuel expansion
- RBA rate hike less relevant (USD earner) but AUD strength could compress margins

### Verdict: WATCHLIST

**Rationale:** At A$6.89-6.94, STO is above our A$6.50-6.80 entry zone from yesterday. The R:R does not work cleanly:
- At A$6.75 entry / A$6.30 stop / A$7.50 target: R:R = 1.67:1 (FAILS 2:1 minimum)
- Need either: lower entry (A$6.60) or higher target (A$7.80) for R:R to pass

**If entry zone reached (A$6.60-6.70):**
- Entry: A$6.65
- Stop: A$6.25 (below A$6.30 support)
- Target: A$7.50 (conservative)
- R:R: (A$7.50 - A$6.65) / (A$6.65 - A$6.25) = A$0.85 / A$0.40 = 2.13:1 (passes)
- Position: A$1,500 / A$6.65 = ~225 shares. Risk: 225 x A$0.40 = A$90

**Timeline:** Monitor daily through Feb 17. If pullback to A$6.60-6.70 before results, consider entry. If holds above A$6.85 into results, WAIT for post-results price action.
