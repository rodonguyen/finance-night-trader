# THESIS REVIEW: AGL Energy (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Post-Earnings (1H26 Results Today)

**Summary:** AGL reported 1H26 results today, beating consensus. Underlying profit A$353M vs A$307M consensus. Narrowed FY26 guidance. Divesting telco business. This was our TOP PICK from yesterday.

**Trade type:** SWING (5-10 days)

### What Happened Today
- 1H26 statutory profit: A$94M
- 1H26 underlying profit: A$353M (beat consensus A$307M by 15%)
- Interim dividend: A$0.24/share (fully franked)
- FY26 guidance narrowed (specifics TBC -- need to confirm levels)
- Divesting telco business to Aussie Broadband (ABB) -- simplification positive
- Targeting A$50M sustainable net cost reductions in FY27
- 2H expected to be seasonally lower

### Edge (from yesterday's research, now validated)
- This was our #1 pick yesterday at A$8.85 with "BUY around results" verdict
- Results have now CONFIRMED the thesis: underlying profit beat by 15%
- Valuation: ~10x forward P/E, 5%+ dividend yield
- CEO insider buying: Damien Nicks bought A$203k @ A$8.84 (same level as current price)
- Data center power exposure: Microsoft contract, Pottinger Energy Park (1,300MW wind + 500MW battery)
- 25% off 52-week highs

### Bull Case
- Results beat validates the underlying business quality
- Cost reduction program (A$50M FY27) shows management discipline
- Telco divestiture = cleaner, more focused business
- AI/data center power demand structural tailwind
- Yield support at 5%+ provides downside floor
- Insider buying at these levels

### Bear Case
- Earnings still declining YoY (1H26 underlying A$353M vs 1H25 A$377M)
- Heavy capex phase for coal-to-renewables transition
- 2H expected weaker (seasonal)
- Wholesale electricity price exposure creates earnings volatility
- Transition risk: execution on Pottinger Energy Park is multi-year

### Verdict: PROCEED -- SWING TRADE

**Rationale:** This is the best R:R setup on the ASX today. The earnings beat validates our thesis from yesterday. The stock was our top pick BEFORE results, and results exceeded expectations. Key factors:
1. CEO buying at this exact level (A$8.84)
2. 15% consensus beat on underlying profit
3. 5%+ yield provides downside support
4. 10x P/E is cheap for a utility with growth catalysts
5. 25% off highs with clear catalysts ahead

### Trade Setup

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Entry** | A$8.50-8.90 (current zone) |
| **Stop** | A$8.00 (below 52-week low of A$8.03, gives breathing room) |
| **Target 1** | A$9.80 (prior support/resistance, ~+12%) |
| **Target 2** | A$10.50 (medium-term, ~+20%) |
| **R:R** (at A$8.70 entry, A$8.00 stop, A$9.80 target) | ($9.80 - $8.70) / ($8.70 - $8.00) = $1.10 / $0.70 = **1.57:1** |
| **R:R** (at A$8.50 entry, A$8.00 stop, A$9.80 target) | ($9.80 - $8.50) / ($8.50 - $8.00) = $1.30 / $0.50 = **2.60:1** |
| **Position size** | A$2,000 / A$8.70 = ~229 shares |
| **Risk at A$8.70** | 229 x A$0.70 = A$160 (within A$200 limit) |

**IMPORTANT R:R NOTE:** At A$8.70 entry the R:R is only 1.57:1, which FAILS our 2:1 minimum. We need entry at A$8.50 or below for proper R:R, OR we tighten the stop to A$8.20 (but that's tight and risks getting stopped out on noise).

**Alternative setup with tighter stop:**
- Entry: A$8.70, Stop: A$8.25, Target: A$9.80
- R:R: $1.10 / $0.45 = 2.44:1 (passes)
- Risk: 229 x $0.45 = A$103
- BUT: A$8.25 stop is only 5% below entry -- could get stopped out on normal volatility

**Recommendation:** Wait for any post-earnings profit-taking dip to A$8.50 or below for optimal entry. If AGL holds above A$8.80 today (market digests results positively), consider entering at A$8.70-8.80 with the tighter A$8.25 stop.

**Timeline:** Today through Friday. If no entry by Friday, reassess.
