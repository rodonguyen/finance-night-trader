# THESIS REVIEW: CSL (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Post-Earnings + CEO Departure

**Summary:** CSL dropped ~8% after simultaneous CEO departure and weak 1H26 results with A$1.1B in impairments.

**Trade type:** SWING / POSITION (if entry materializes)

### What Happened
- CEO Paul McKenzie stepped down effective immediately (Feb 10, announced late in session)
- Board stated: "we recognized he didn't have the skills that we wanted for the future"
- Gordon Naylor named interim CEO
- 1H26 NPAT plunged 81% YoY to US$401M (one-off restructuring + asset impairments)
- Underlying NPATA: US$1.9B, down 7%
- Revenue: US$8.3B, down 4%
- US$1.1B impairments mainly relating to CSL Vifor and CSL Seqirus
- Guidance reaffirmed despite the mess
- US$1.5B expansion of US plasma manufacturing announced

### Edge
- Market is pricing in maximum uncertainty (CEO vacuum + headline NPAT collapse)
- But underlying business arguably not as bad: guidance maintained, Vifor revenue +12%
- Analyst consensus targets: A$188-283 range, average ~A$232
- At A$158, trading at ~32% discount to average analyst target
- 52-week high was A$275; stock has lost 43% in 12 months

### Bull Case
- Analyst average target A$232 implies >45% upside from A$158
- Impairments are one-off, underlying NPATA tells cleaner story (US$1.9B)
- Guidance maintained -- board knows where the business is going
- CEO departure may actually be positive: board "impatient" for change
- Plasma collection volumes growing, CSL Vifor revenue +12%
- New CEO search could be a catalyst (proven biotech leader appointment)

### Bear Case
- No permanent CEO -- leadership vacuum creates execution risk
- Seqirus spin-off abandoned, 3,000 job cuts, strategic direction unclear
- Revenue declining (-4%), margins under pressure
- US flu vaccination rates declining (Seqirus headwind)
- FY26 revenue growth guidance already slashed to 2-3% in October
- Could see further downgrades as analysts revise models post-earnings
- "Catching a falling knife" -- stock down 43% from highs for real reasons

### Verdict: WAIT

**Rationale:** The sell-off is significant and the discount to analyst targets is tempting, but I want to see:
1. Post-earnings analyst revisions (targets may come down)
2. Price stabilization (no more forced selling / fund rebalancing)
3. At least 2-3 days of price discovery at these levels
4. Any hints on permanent CEO timeline

**If re-entering:** I would look at A$150-155 as a better entry zone if the selling continues.
- Entry: A$152-158 (after stabilization confirmed)
- Stop: A$142 (below psychological A$150 + buffer)
- Target: A$180 (prior support, conservative)
- R:R at A$155 entry / A$142 stop / A$180 target: 1.92:1 -- borderline
- R:R at A$150 entry / A$140 stop / A$180 target: 3.0:1 -- acceptable
- Position size at A$155: A$2,000 max = ~12.9 shares. Risk = 12.9 x $13 = $167 (within $200 limit)

**Timeline to reassess:** Friday Feb 13 or Monday Feb 16
