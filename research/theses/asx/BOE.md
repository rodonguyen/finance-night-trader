# THESIS REVIEW: BOE -- Boss Energy (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Uranium Sector Pullback

**Summary:** BOE down 3.5% to A$1.68 amid broad uranium sector weakness. U3O8 spot pulled back from $101.50 to ~$92/lb. Structural bull thesis intact.

**Trade type:** SWING (if entry zone reached)

### What Happened
- Uranium sector broadly sold off: BOE -3.5%, PDN -2.4%, BMN -2.9%
- U3O8 spot price volatile: hit $101.50 recently, pulled back to ~$92/lb
- Despite pullback, U3O8 still +4.9% YTD and +24.4% YoY
- No company-specific negative news for BOE

### Company Fundamentals
- Honeymoon mine producing: 456klbs in latest quarter, sales 350klbs
- C1 cost: A$30/lb (excellent against ~US$92 spot)
- FY26 guidance: 1.6Mlbs U3O8
- AISC guidance: A$64-70/lb (US$41-45/lb)
- Generating positive free cash flow
- Also owns Alta Mesa (US) -- additional production upside

### Edge
- BOE is a producing uranium miner with sub-$50/lb AISC operating in a $90+ spot market
- Canaccord sees structural uranium deficit: -15Mlb (2026), -13Mlb (2027), -23Mlb (2028)
- 70+ reactors under construction globally
- Western de-risking from Russian/Kazakh supply is structural

### Bull Case
- Massive margin at current U3O8 prices (AISC ~$45 vs spot ~$92)
- Structural supply deficit growing through 2028
- Data center demand for nuclear power (new demand source)
- US government actively supporting domestic uranium (regulatory easing)
- Producing asset with low costs -- operating leverage to spot price

### Bear Case
- U3O8 spot volatility -- could pull back further to $80-85 range
- Small producer -- liquidity risk in sell-offs
- Execution risk on production ramp
- Uzbekistan supply increases could pressure market near-term

### Verdict: WAIT

**Rationale:** The thesis is strong but the current pullback may not be complete. U3O8 dropped from $101.50 to $92 -- that's only a 9% pullback from highs. If spot drops to $85-88, BOE could test A$1.50 or lower.

Yesterday's research identified PDN as the preferred uranium play at $10.50-11.50. BOE is more leveraged (smaller, earlier stage) but also more volatile.

**If entry materializes:**
- Entry: A$1.50-1.55 (below current A$1.68, needs further pullback)
- Stop: A$1.38 (below recent support, ~A$0.15 risk per share)
- Target: A$1.95 (prior resistance level)
- R:R at A$1.52 entry: ($1.95 - $1.52) / ($1.52 - $1.38) = $0.43 / $0.14 = 3.07:1
- Position size: A$2,000 / A$1.52 = ~1,315 shares. Risk = 1,315 x $0.14 = A$184 (within A$200 limit)

**Timeline to reassess:** If U3O8 spot stabilizes above $90 and BOE holds A$1.55+, could enter by Feb 13-14.
