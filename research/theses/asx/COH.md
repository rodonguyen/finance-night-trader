# THESIS REVIEW: COH -- Cochlear (ASX)

## 2026-02-11 -- Pre-Earnings Watch (R2)

**Summary:** COH reports 1H26 results tomorrow (Feb 12). Healthcare sector down -3.93% today on CSL sympathy. If COH delivers solid results, could rally against depressed sector. If misses, sympathy selling could create A$230-240 entry for a position trade.

**Trade type:** WATCH -- potential SWING or POSITION post-results

### Key Data
- Current price: ~A$250-269 (volatile intraday)
- Analyst consensus target: A$307.55 (14-23% upside)
- P/E: 44.9x (always trades at premium)
- Recent revenue: A$2.34B (+4.8% YoY)
- Earnings: A$389M (+9% YoY)
- EPS: A$5.94
- Consensus FY27 EPS forecast: A$6.89
- Dividend: A$4.30/share, 1.6% yield
- 1H26 results: February 12, 2026

### Edge
- Global leader in cochlear implants -- duopoly with MED-EL
- Aging population tailwind (hearing loss prevalence increasing)
- Healthcare sector selloff may create undeserved discount on quality peers
- CSL sympathy drag: healthcare -3.93% today on CSL-specific issues

### Bull Case
- Consistent revenue and earnings growth (+4.8% rev, +9% earnings)
- Defensive healthcare franchise with pricing power
- If results beat, could rally strongly against negative sector sentiment
- Analyst consensus implies 14-23% upside from current levels

### Bear Case
- Expensive at 44.9x P/E -- no room for misses
- Position sizing is difficult: at A$250, A$2,000 buys only 8 shares
- Binary earnings risk tomorrow
- AUD strength (if RBA hikes continue) could compress international earnings
- Healthcare sector de-rating could continue regardless of COH results

### Verdict: WATCH RESULTS TOMORROW

**Not actionable today.** Binary event tomorrow.

**Scenario A -- COH beats:**
- Likely rallies to A$270-280. At those levels, too expensive to chase.
- PASS unless A$270 pullback provides clean swing entry.

**Scenario B -- COH misses + sympathy sell:**
- Watch for A$230-240 zone (below recent lows)
- Entry: A$235, Stop: A$215, Target: A$275
- R:R: (A$275 - A$235) / (A$235 - A$215) = A$40 / A$20 = 2.0:1 (borderline)
- Position: A$2,000 / A$235 = ~8.5 shares. Risk: 8.5 x A$20 = A$170
- This would be a POSITION TRADE (hold through sector recovery)

**Timeline:** Decision point Feb 12-13 based on results.
