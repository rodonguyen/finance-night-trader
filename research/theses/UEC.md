# UEC — Uranium Energy Corp

## 2026-02-07 — Thesis Review (PROCEED)

```
THESIS REVIEW: UEC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Summary: Uranium bottleneck play in nuclear/AI power theme at pullback entry
Trade type: SWING
Timeframe: 2-10 days (initial), may convert to position if thesis strengthens
Edge: Structural uranium supply deficit (180M lbs demand vs 130M production) + AI data center power demand driving nuclear renaissance
Theme lifecycle: Acceleration phase — hyperscaler nuclear deals signed, uranium price at $100/lb, ahead of mainstream recognition
Bull case:
  - Uranium at $100/lb, 20-month high
  - Structural supply deficit projected to widen
  - BofA target $135/lb uranium by 2026
  - Hyperscaler nuclear contracts (10+ GW signed 2024-2025)
  - US-based pure-play producer
  - Pulled back ~10% from highs, creating entry
Bear case:
  - Commodity price can reverse sharply
  - Small-cap volatility
  - Uranium market is thin/illiquid
  - Policy risk (nuclear regulation)
Key risks:
  - Break below $14.50 support invalidates near-term setup
  - Broad commodity selloff
  - Uranium spot price reversal
Verdict: PROCEED (Confidence: MEDIUM)
