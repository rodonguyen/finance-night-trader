# UEC — Uranium Energy Corp

## 2026-02-07 — Thesis Review (PROCEED)

```
THESIS REVIEW: UEC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Summary: Uranium bottleneck play in nuclear/AI power theme at pullback entry
Trade type: SWING
Timeframe: 2-10 days (initial), may convert to position if thesis strengthens
Edge: Structural uranium supply deficit (180M lbs demand vs 130M production) + AI data center power demand driving nuclear renaissance
Theme lifecycle: Acceleration phase — hyperscaler nuclear deals signed, uranium price at $100/lb, ahead of mainstream recognition
Bull case:
  - Uranium at $100/lb, 20-month high
  - Structural supply deficit projected to widen
  - BofA target $135/lb uranium by 2026
  - Hyperscaler nuclear contracts (10+ GW signed 2024-2025)
  - US-based pure-play producer
  - Pulled back ~10% from highs, creating entry
Bear case:
  - Commodity price can reverse sharply
  - Small-cap volatility
  - Uranium market is thin/illiquid
  - Policy risk (nuclear regulation)
Key risks:
  - Break below $14.50 support invalidates near-term setup
  - Broad commodity selloff
  - Uranium spot price reversal
Verdict: PROCEED (Confidence: MEDIUM)
```

## 2026-02-09 — Position Update

### Stop Management
- **Stop moved to breakeven: $14.50 → $15.58**
- UEC trading ~$16.12-$17.86 range (sources differ on exact close Feb 7)
- 1:1 R:R achieved from entry — per management plan, stop goes to breakeven

### Thesis Review: HOLD (Strengthening)

Uranium fundamentals update:
- Uranium spot: $85-$96/lb (pulled back from $100 Jan high, still elevated)
- Goldman Sachs raised UEC price target to $18 (from $16) on Feb 4
- UEC produced 68,612 lbs in fiscal Q1 2026 — operational ramp confirmed
- Structural thesis intact: supply deficit, reactor buildout, data center power demand
- UEC filed shelf registration for 6M shares (dilution risk to watch)

R1+R2 joint view:
- Both recommend HOLD with stop at breakeven
- If $18.00 hits → sell 50% (64 shares), trail rest with stop at $16.50
- Thesis strengthened by Goldman upgrade and production ramp
- UEC fits R2's "Great Rebalancing" theme (uranium = nuclear = AI baseload power)

### Updated Management Plan
- Stop: $15.58 (breakeven) — DONE
- At $18.00 → Sell 50% (64 shares), trail rest with stop at $16.50
- If uranium spot breaks below $80 → reassess entire thesis
